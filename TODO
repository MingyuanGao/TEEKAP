1. Add attested TLS terminating in enclaves
   An Attested TLS channel is a TLS channel that integrates remote attestation validation as part of the TLS channel establishing process. 
   Once established, it guarantees that an attested connecting party is running inside a TEE with expected identity.
2. Unify the AES API accross the project: a common aes_encryption_header_t needs to be defined to reduce code duplication.
3. Switchless ECall: using *ring buffers* for host-enclave and enclave-host communication
4. Choose a more efficient serialization library, e.g., Google's Protocol Buffers
